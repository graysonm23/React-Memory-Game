## React-Memory-Game
This project I put together a react memomory game using the React.js library. 

## Deployment Link
[Heroku](https://pure-retreat-01195.herokuapp.com/)

## How It Was Made
It was made utilizing ```npx create-react-app```. Then, to run the server you can run ```npm start``` or ```react-scripts start``` which, all of those dependencies will be found in package.json
Every component that is going to be created should be put in your components folder inside the src folder.
